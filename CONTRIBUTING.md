# How to Contribute

## Code of Conduct
SMA Technologies Innovation Lab has adopted the Contributor Covenant as its [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and we expect project participants to adhere to it. Please read the full text so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Bugs
### Where to Find Known Issues
GitHub Issues is used for public bugs, browse existing in the repository's Issues.
### Reporting New Issues
File a new issue and label it with 'Bug'. Before filing a new issue, try to make sure your problem doesn’t already exist browsing existing issues.

## Proposing a Change
Changes are submitted via Pull Request. Ideally we recommend filing an issue first, this lets both parties reach an agreement on the proposal before you put significant effort into it.
If you’re only fixing a bug, it’s fine to submit a pull request right away but we still recommend to file an issue detailing what you’re fixing. This is helpful in case the specific fix isn't accepted but want to keep track of the issue.

## Your First Pull Request
Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free video series:

- [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

If you decide to fix an issue, please be sure to check the comment thread in case somebody is already working on a fix. If nobody is working on it at the moment, please leave a comment stating that you intend to work on it so other people don’t accidentally duplicate your effort.

If somebody claims an issue but doesn’t follow up for more than two weeks, it’s fine to take it over but you should still leave a comment.

## Sending a Pull Request
The repository owners are monitoring for pull requests. The repo owners review the pull request to either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an explanation. Repository owners are expected to do their best to provide updates and feedback throughout the process.

By default submit all changes directly to the master branch via Pull Requests - unless the repository you are contributing to has specific instructions.

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:
- Fork the repository and create your branch from master.
- If you’ve fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!
- Format your code with prettier.
- Ensure it compiles & runs.
- Ensure the test suite passes.

> For further guided instructions on how to perform Github related steps (fork repo, create a branch, commit, create pull requests...), read the published [user guide](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects).

## Propose new project / repository
SMA Technologies Innovation Lab fosters contribution on existing projects as much as possible, in order to improve existing - however when a new idea pops up and there are no existing projects that capture this idea, we want to provide a place to host its seed and facilitate collaboration on growing that idea.

- First, browse our [Innovation Lab's repositories](https://github.com/SMATechnologies) to make sure your idea does not already exist, or could take form of an enhancement of an existing project.

- Still want to start your own project? Send us a brief email at seed-innovation-lab@smatechnologies.com with the following information:
  - Project name
  - Brief project Description
    - Purpose
    - Technology
  - Your github user
>The Innovation Lab team will get back to you, when approved they will create a new repository using our [repo-template](https://github.com/SMATechnologies/repo-template) as template, add your Github user as repository owner, and you'll be good to go.
